Entrance exams can be stressful, but consistent practice makes a big difference.

- Review the official syllabus released by the exam authority.
- Work through previous years' question papers to understand the pattern.
- Join mock test series offered by coaching centers or online platforms.
- Balance revision with regular breaks to avoid burnout.

Staying focused and managing your time effectively will boost your score.
