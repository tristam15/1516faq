Banks across India offer education loans for undergraduate and postgraduate study.

1. Compare interest rates across nationalized and private banks.
2. Prepare a detailed cost estimate including tuition, books, and living expenses.
3. Understand the moratorium period before repayment begins.

Careful planning ensures you borrow only what you need and can repay comfortably.
