# Search Functionality

This documentation explains how to use and customize the search functionality in the FAQ site.

## Features

- Client-side search using Fuse.js
- Fuzzy search capabilities
- Search across page titles, content, and descriptions
- Responsive design

## How to Add Search to a Page

1. Add the search component to any page using the shortcode:

   ```
   {{< search >}}
   ```

2. The search bar will appear where the shortcode is placed.

## How It Works

1. When the page loads, the search index is fetched from `/search-index.json`
2. As the user types, Fuse.js performs a fuzzy search on the client side
3. Results are displayed in real-time below the search input

## Customization

### Styling

You can customize the search appearance by modifying the SCSS file:
`/assets/scss/custom/_search.scss`

### Search Behavior

To adjust the search behavior (fuzzy matching, weights, etc.), modify the `fuseOptions` in `/assets/js/search.js`.

### Search Index

The search index is automatically generated by Hugo and includes:
- Page titles
- Page content (first 200 characters for description)
- Section information
- Permalinks

## Dependencies

- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) - For client-side fuzzy searching
- Bootstrap 5 - For styling (included by default in the theme)

## Troubleshooting

- **Search not working**: Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
- **No results found**: Ensure the search index is being generated correctly at `/search-index.json`
- **Styling issues**: Verify that the CSS is being loaded and there are no conflicts with other styles

## Performance

The search is performed entirely on the client side, so it's fast and doesn't require server requests after the initial page load. The search index is only loaded once when the page loads.
